## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab 4, part 1 

 This was one of my favorite lab because I liked how we made loops to help us calculate different units from milliliters to teaspoons to tablespoons to ounces to cups. Which helps us convert to different units from just submitting a unit to convert to another.

*Lab 11 part 1

 This was my second favorite lab because I like how we were able to find each state's population density. Then be able to tell which one had the highest and lowest by dividing the population by the land area.

*Lab 12 

 This was a cool lab because I liked how in part-1 we made an image with color which was really cool to make and see that it worked. Then in Part -2, we created a random number generator where we were able to make an image with a text in which was really cool coding.
